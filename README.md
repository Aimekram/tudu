It's a booring app for all the exciting stuff you have to do in your wonderful life.

<br>

## Stack

Let's stick to the world class standards:

-   Next.js
-   TypeScript
-   Jest
-   MUI

<br>

## MVP scope

-   [ ] each task consists of: title, creation date
-   [ ] tasks can be created
-   [ ] tasks can be deleted
-   [ ] tasks are stored in LocalStorage
-   [ ] tasks have 2 states: todo and done
-   [ ] tasks list displays all added tasks
-   [ ] the functionality is tested

<br>

## Ideas for later

-   [ ] PWA
-   [ ] tasks are saved in MongoDB db
-   [ ] tasks draggable in tasks list
-   [ ] tasks have 3rd state "in progress"
